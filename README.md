# Tax-calculator
A simple Python program that calculates income tax based on Philippine tax brackets.  It supports different deduction types like Standard, Itemized, and OSD (Optional Standard Deduction).  Built to automate a tedious school assignment where multiple tax scenarios had to be solved manually.

This is a Python program that calculates annual and monthly tax based on the Philippine tax system.
It supports three deduction types:

### Standard – No additional deduction.

### Itemized – Enter your own deduction amount.

### OSD (Optional Standard Deduction) – Automatically deducts 40% of your income.

Why I Made This
We had a school assignment where we needed to compute a lot of tax scenarios for different incomes and deductions. Doing it by hand was slow and prone to error, so I made this script to speed it up and make sure the calculations were correct.
